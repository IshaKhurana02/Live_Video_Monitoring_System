## 📊 Real-Time Alerts

All detection events are logged and stored in MongoDB with structured metadata for analysis and visualization. Each alert contains:

- 🕒 **Timestamp** of the event  
- 🎯 **Type of event** (e.g., Intrusion, Fire, Fall)  
- 📷 **Camera ID** or stream source  
- 📍 **Bounding box coordinates** (if applicable)  
- 📡 **Location metadata** (optional, if GPS or zone mapping is enabled)

These records can be:
- Queried for post-event analysis  
- Streamed to dashboards  
- Used for real-time alerts via webhooks or mobile notifications  
- Exported to CSV/JSON for offline reports  

You can easily connect these alerts to a frontend dashboard (Grafana, Streamlit, or custom UI) or integrate with security management systems.
