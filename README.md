🔍 Intelligent Live Video Monitoring System
A real-time, scalable, and intelligent CCTV surveillance solution designed to monitor multiple live video streams and detect critical events such as:

🚷 Intrusion detection

🌀 Loitering behavior

👥 Crowd formation & dispersion

🔥 Fire and smoke detection

🤕 Fall detection

🚶‍♂️ Person in/out tracking

🔀 Wrong direction movement

📣 Directional alarms

Built for high-performance edge deployment and real-time alerting, this system is engineered to support security, public safety, and automation use cases.

🚀 Features
Multi-event detection using advanced deep learning models.

Real-time object tracking with YOLOv5, Faster R-CNN, and custom detectors.

Low-latency video processing using GStreamer and ZeroMQ (ZMQ).

Multi-stream handling from various IP/CCTV cameras.

Edge-optimized pipelines for resource-efficient deployment.

Dockerized setup for easy deployment on any environment.

Alert logging and structured data management via MongoDB.

Modular architecture enabling scalability and plug-n-play components.

⚙️ Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/intelligent-video-monitoring.git
cd intelligent-video-monitoring
2. Build Docker Container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t intelligent-monitoring .
3. Run the container
bash
Copy
Edit
docker run -it --rm -p 5000:5000 intelligent-monitoring
4. MongoDB Setup
Ensure MongoDB is running locally or remotely. Configure the URI in config.json or .env.

📊 Real-Time Alerts & MongoDB
All detection alerts are:

Time-stamped

Labeled with event type and camera ID

Stored in MongoDB for retrieval, dashboarding, or integration with external systems.

📈 Performance
⚡ Achieved ~30% reduction in processing latency on edge devices.

📶 Tested on 4 concurrent streams without significant frame drops.

🧠 Models fine-tuned for low-power devices (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi 4, etc).
